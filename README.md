## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I finally learned how to get a element to be centered, both vertically and horizontally using flexbox. I had a lot of difficulty understanding how to centerd the elements before, but with this project I'm confident that the next ones are going to be much simpler to do.

### Continued development

I still have to practice a lot in terms of how to properly write the CSS side, because I feel like the spacing could be written in a much easier to understand way, so I would like to work on that next.
